New board
    Sonar green wire is cut
    laser server gets loose


Doc Board problems
    Opposite side motors must have pins swapped
    noise on servos because of motor lines. Must add 1k resistor

# Tasks
    Obstacle detection 
        when entering driving mode, must check for obstruction and block trigger + rumble
        while driving, detect object from a longer distance to give time to brake

    Auto-calibration
        on boot, for a few seconds. Set LED to indicate that system is calibrating
        accelerometer: X,Y should be 0, Z should be 9.8
        Magneto: The device would need to be facing north. A compass would need to be installed on the device
                 Maybe calibration should be on demand then instead of on reboot
        ADC for battery
                would need to build another board that would vary a voltage on the ADC and detect it. This is an elaborate circuit
        

# Bugs
Speed metrics is wrong
ps5 controller battery level is accurate?
