# Tasks
    Re-assing LED ring

    Route recording
        record buffer is small. use SPIFFS

    Obstacle detection  
        Use IR range finder. Extend steering servo horn so that sensor rotates with steering
            Sharp GP2D12 only works for distances over 10cm. Under 10cm, we get a voltage curve that we cannot distinguish between a real reading over 10cm.
            Being too close would be interpreted as being too far. For example, 1.2v is either 36cm or 2cm
            So need to install the sensor 10cm inside the vehicle to make sure nothing  gets too close to the sensor
        Or use bumper switches            

    Pointing device on small servo, controlled with up/down buttons on the left side of DS


    PCB for mainboard
        4 DRV8871
        socket for ESP
        terminal headers
        accelerometer / gyro
        voltage divider on analog pin for battery level detection


    Bumper switches to provide feedback on collisions
