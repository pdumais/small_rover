Pending Design
    Frame
        with rotating steering base
    Power supply
        battery: nimh, ni-ion, 12v. check at BatteryExpert
        regulator for 5V
        find old drill?
    Controller
        The Dualsense does not support BLE, but the esp32s3 is only BLE. So we need to install the PS5 firmware on a regular esp32
        
    Camera
        stream thru wifi
            how to do this thru esp32?
    Arm
        simple claw. 4 motors max, so that we can control with ps5 controller

    GPS
        to set path to follow
        or to set boundaries to not go into


Steps
    Wiating for order:
        hex adapters to use  old rc car wheels
        drv8871

    Test ps5 controller
        use huzzah
        send data thru i2c and receive it from other ESP
        ESP should set servo position based on left stick

    Make brackets for wheels and motor
        test motor speed and control with PWM using DRV8871
        make a bracket by templating the holes
        modular. Can pivot or be fixed on vehicle frame.

    firmware
        throttle with R2
        reverse using L2
        steering with L stick right/left
    
    Make frame with:
        axles
        battery
        steering with servo (see steering.webp)

    Camera
        can turn using servo

    Arm
         
    GPS

    LED/buzzer
        when no PS5 controller
        when GPS lost
        when no wifi
