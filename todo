# currently working on:
    paint frame
    reassemble
    how to fit arm on there?




# Steps
    make a 3.5" circle and weld on lazy suzan
    Lock "latest" in docker commands to IDF release-v5.1

    Implement sleep mode where very low power is consumed. I can then wakeup the bot using a switch or by sending a wifi packet

    PS5 controller
        when booting while pressing a button, try to pair with a controller for 10s, within the main thread.
        Use a panel mount momentary button wired to ESP

    Arm
        servo control with PS5 controller
            controller value does not set the angle, it sets a speed at which we increase the angle
                i.e: if value 127, then increase the angle by 1 every second. If 64, increase by 0.5 every second

        rotating base
            use lady-suzan bearing. 3 to 4"
            rotate with servo attached to middle of plate.

# Current Issues
    - ps5 board is receiving a lot of ps5 messages per seconds. 
        try adding log in the arduino lib and test it.  ~/Arduino/libraries/ps5Controller/src/ps5_l2cap.c :ps5_l2cap_data_ind_cback


# Pending Design
    Arm
        ?? Get 12V servos? Or get a high current step-down?

        Backhoe with grapple
        needs 4 servos
            mg996R:
                Stall torque: 12kg
                weight: 60g
                Amps: 3    <-- cannot use a small buck converter for all servos
                Voltage: 5v
