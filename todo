# Tasks
    laser pointers
    bumper switches
    Obstacle detection 
        do a continuous sweep 
            when closest object is too close, turn steering to angle with fartest object
            when fartest object is at angle 0, turn back wheels to 0
        only activate servo while in autonomous mode or while driving
        use 2 distance sensors?
        mount on machine
        make autonomous algorithm
        on obstacle detection, stop turning servo and focus on that area until obstacle is not present anymore

    Pointing device on small servo, controlled with up/down buttons on the left side of DS


    PCB for mainboard
        4 DRV8871
        socket for ESP
        terminal headers
        accelerometer / gyro
        voltage divider on analog pin for battery level detection
