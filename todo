# Tasks
    Route recording
        record buffer is small. After the buffer is full, we should flush to flash
        set led status when recording or replaying

    PCB for mainboard
        4 DRV8871
        socket for ESP
        terminal headers

    Deep sleep
        Does not work properly.
        Will servos use any current?
        LEDs are still lit on both boards

    Obstacle detection  
        Use lidar ?

    got to beacon
        would need to avoid obstacles

    PS5 controller
        when booting while pressing a button, try to pair with a controller for 10s, within the main thread.
        because if the controller is not paired, we need to pair it. And this can only be done if we use ps5_l2cap_reconnect() (active mode). We have stopped invoking this because it seems to conflict when listening for an incomming connection (passive). We want to stay in passive mode. But we want to enable
        Active mode on boot if the user wants to pair a new controller
        Use a panel mount momentary button wired to ESP

    Power supply
        Instead of being on main board, should be a separate unit that exposes a few cables for each components to use.
        PS would sit on top of battery
