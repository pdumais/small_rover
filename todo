        Add servo to rotate claw?


# Tasks

    PCB for mainboard
        4 DRV8871
        socket for ESP
        terminal headers

    Deep sleep
        Does not work properly.
        Will servos use any current?
        LEDs are still lit on both boards

    Obstacle detection  
        dualsense rumble when obstacle. or feedback on the throttle button
            unfortunately, the dualsense library I'm using does not work when trying to send commands towards the controller. https://github.com/rodneybakiskan/ps5-esp32/issues/3
            Is it easy to fix?
        Use IR range finder. Extend steering servo horn so that sensor rotates with steering

    PS5 controller
        Use a panel mount momentary button wired to ESP pin 18 to initiate pairing. It is already implemented, just need the button

    Route recording
        record buffer is small. After the buffer is full, we should flush to flash

    Power supply
        Instead of being on main board, should be a separate unit that exposes a few cables for each components to use.
        PS would sit on top of battery
