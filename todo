# currently working on:
    Arm
        make Claw
        Add servo to rotate claw?
            weight of the claw would stress the servo shaft? Doesn't matter. I can try it without a bearing at first


# Tasks
    Re-assing LED ring
        same as now for disconnected
        while moving, flash proportional to speed
            only 1 of 4 quarters in the direction of vehicle: left,right, straight from, straight back
    i2c
        I had to put a delay when transmitting 2 packets in a row from the slave. Also, master always reads something
            when slave has nothing in FIFO. why is something being clocked out?

    How to monitor battery level?

    Route recording
        record buffer is small. After the buffer is full, we should flush to flash
        after 100 events (or whatever it takes to create 3.5k, flush the page
            struct page {
                char nextkey[4]
                record_data[100]
                int record_count
            }
            use the last generated random key, or "record_data" if it's the first page
            generate a new key, set that key as the "nextkey"
            set the record_count.
            re-init buffer.
            on stop: write last page with an empty "nextpage"


    PCB for mainboard
        4 DRV8871
        socket for ESP
        terminal headers
        accelerometer / gyro

    Obstacle detection  
        Use IR range finder. Extend steering servo horn so that sensor rotates with steering
            Sharp GP2D12 only works for distances over 10cm. Under 10cm, we get a voltage curve that we cannot distinguish between a real reading over 10cm.
            Being too close would be interpreted as being too far. For example, 1.2v is either 36cm or 2cm
            So need to install the sensor 10cm inside the vehicle to make sure nothing  gets too close to the sensor
        Or use bumper switches            

    Pointing device on small servo, controlled with up/down buttons on the left side of DS

    better frame
        cube. 50cm x 40cm
        steering with ball joints
        bumper switches to provide feedback on collisions

        Power supply
            Instead of being on main board, should be a separate unit that exposes a few cables for each components to use.
            PS would sit on top of battery
