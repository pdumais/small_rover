    Waiting for Battery. Final test
    
    Arm
        Make rotating base 



# Tasks
    Arm
        Order servos
        make a top shelf over the battery and main board to put stuff in.
        make rotating platform
            make a 3.5" circle and weld on lazy suzan
                constrain build to that platform
        make boom
        make arm
        Make claw

        servo control with PS5 controller
            controller value does not set the angle, it sets a speed at which we increase the angle
                i.e: if value 127, then increase the angle by 1 every second. If 64, increase by 0.5 every second

    PCB for mainboard
        4 DRV8871
        socket for ESP
        terminal headers

    Deep sleep
        Will servos use any current?
        LEDs are still lit on both boards


    PS5 controller
        when booting while pressing a button, try to pair with a controller for 10s, within the main thread.
        because if the controller is not paired, we need to pair it. And this can only be done if we use ps5_l2cap_reconnect() (active mode). We have stopped invoking this because it seems to conflict when listening for an incomming connection (passive). We want to stay in passive mode. But we want to enable
        Active mode on boot if the user wants to pair a new controller
        Use a panel mount momentary button wired to ESP


# Other ideas
    Power supply
        Instead of being on main board, should be a separate unit that exposes a few cables for each components to use.
        PS would sit on top of battery

    GPS
    Camera
    LIDAR
